# CT-COVID19

Here are some visualizations of Connecticut COVID-19 data. The data are (mostly) accessed through the state's [open data portal](www.ctdata.org) using the Socrata API and the RSocrata R package.

I built these visualizations as an excuse to play with several R features that I wanted to get more familiar with: scraping data from PDF files[(tabulizer)](https://docs.ropensci.org/tabulizer/), using an API for data access [(RSocrata)](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata), working with geo-linked data and building choropleths[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), and animated dataviz. Haven't got around to the animations yet, but you'll find examples of all the others in this repo.

WARNING: I am not even close to being an epidemiologist or contagious disease expert. If you're looking for an expert take on anything to do with COVID-19, then you're in the wrong place.
